	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>Hi, I'm Nate. I am a web developer calling Fresno, California my home. I am very interesting in web technology and building things that are user-friendly. I am originally from Missouri.</p>
	<h4>Web Developer</h4>
	<p>I am familiar with JavaScript technologies such as jQuery, Node, Express, and Angular. I am constantly learning, and I will always be evolving my skills. I began my web development learning while I was attending college as a Music Industry major. It was in my Programming I and Website Administration classes that I decided that I wanted to become a web developer. I started learning with online resourced like <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, and <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>. I never looked back!</p>

	<p>I am very excited about the future of the web and I am excited to know that I will be a part of it in some way.</p>

	<h4>Musician</h4>
	<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.mssu.edu">Missouri Southern State University</a> in 2015 with a Bachelor of General Stuides and a minor in music. I have had amazing experiences in my time at MSSU, including performing on the professional drumline for the Kansas City Royals of the MLB. I performed at the All-Star Game in 2012, the Post Seasons of 2014 and 2015, performances in Europe and participating in the 2015 World Series victory parade. I also have experience teaching percussion for the Carl Junction, Missouri High School Marching Band for the 2014 and 2015 seasons.</p>
